# Summary

This is a support bracket designed to be used to support two side by side XT30 connectors. This design was designed with the REV Expansion hub or REV control hub in mind. 

The brace comes in two parts. The bottom is designed to be attached to the body of the rev hub either with glue or double sided tape. It is designed to accept a hex head m3 screw, which is used to affix the top. 

Recently, a new bottom model has been added which is meant to screw on with the screw hole on the top of the REV hub as an alternate method of attachment. 

The top part is designed to keep the XT30 connectors from wobbling loose. It clamps down on the connectors using the screw embedded into the bottom part. They should be slightly loose, as room is left for variations in the length of XT30 connectors.

This USB support device was designed by FTC team Robocracy 9773. You can learn more about us on our website: http://www.ftcrobocracy.org
